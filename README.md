# MNIST-Classification-Neural-Network
We will train a neural network for hand-written digit recognition using the MNIST dataset consiting of digits 0-9. 
The MNIST dataset is taken from tensorflow datasets and is split into 70% for training the model and 30% for testing model accuracy.

After training, the model had a 98.17% accuracy in classifying the training set, and a 97.23% accuracy in classifying the test set.
